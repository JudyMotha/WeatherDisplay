# WeatherDisplay -A Learning using APIs
The application does the following-

* When I key in a cityname it displays weather conditions for that day and also a 5 day forecast.
* I am also able to choose a previous searched city  from the dropdown list of cities and display the weather again.
* The city names are stored on local storage
* The UV part is still under construction with one call API
* Future work with ONe call Api for the entir application
